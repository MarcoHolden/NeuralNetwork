## Neural Network Implementation

This repository contains a simple implementation of a neural network with dense layers, ReLU activation, and softmax activation for a classification task. The code is based on the tutorial by SentDex.

## Setup

Make sure to initialize the neural network library before running the code:

```python
import nnfs
nnfs.init()
